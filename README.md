# Configuration

### Webpack
This project uses Webpack as a buildtool which is configured in webpack.development.config.js for local development. <br>
and webpack.production.config.js for production environment.
There are 3 loaders configured which handle the html, scss and js files.<br>
To get more information about the configuration options, see: <a href="https://webpack.js.org">https://webpack.js.org</a>

<ul>
<li>'sass' folder which containes all the scss files</li>
<li>'javascript' folder which contains the es6 javascript partials which are bundled by webpack 
<li>'html' folder which contains the example.html
</li>
</ul>

### Unit testing

The javascript source files are unit tested using Jest as test framework. 
All unit tests are included with full coverage report
the test files have a glob pattern containing: `*.spec.js`



### Config files

Webpack 4 is used together with babel 7 to build js files. Postcss is used together with 2 plugins: 
- autoprefixer to prefix css properties.
- postcss-custom-properties as a fallback.

sass-loader and file-loader are used to bundle the css in a separate css file

- .babelrc : config babel settings
- .eslintrc.js : config eslint settings
- webpack.*.config.js : config webpack settings
- postcss.config.js



### Example

In order to provide an example a simple html file with an unordered list to see the progress bar in action. Of course this can be more complex tabs or sections or whatever for example. Buttons or links to go to next section are disabled by default and the next button will be active until after the current one is invoked.
